workers.txt file:

To change the number of threads and therefore workers, simply 
click the "Choose new number of Threads" drop down in the
constants menu. This will change the variable 
"threads" in the UI class which in turn changes the size of
the ThreadWorker array and number of ThreadWorkers when 
the updateFractal method is called.
